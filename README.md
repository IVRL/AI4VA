- `scripts/`: Contains Python scripts for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Contains saved models.
- `results/`: Contains evaluation metrics and model predictions.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions.
- `LICENSE`: License information.
