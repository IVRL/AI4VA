#### Overview

Our workshop features three challenges focusing on applying computer vision to visual arts, centered around the AI4VA dataset. This dataset, a first-of-its-kind benchmark, is designed to evaluate vision modelsâ€™ ability to interpret comic art, focusing on segmentation, depth, and saliency. It includes detailed annotations of diverse comic styles, such as the toon-styled 'Placid & Muzo'.

#### Challenge Description

In the segmentation challenge, participants are tasked with developing models to accurately segment various elements within comic art images. The goal is to create models that can delineate different components such as characters, objects, and backgrounds, providing clear and accurate boundaries.

#### Dataset

The AI4VA dataset consists of images with detailed annotations specific to the segmentation task. These annotations include:

- **Character boundaries**: Precise outlines of characters.
- **Object segmentation**: Delineations of different objects within the scene.
- **Background segmentation**: Segmentation of the background elements.

The dataset covers a wide range of comic art styles, providing a comprehensive challenge for model generalization and accuracy.

#### Instructions

1. **Download the Dataset**: Follow the instructions in the `data/README.md` to download and set up the AI4VA dataset.

2. **Data Exploration**: Use the `notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb` to understand the dataset structure and visualize the annotations.

3. **Baseline Model**: Start with the `notebooks/baseline_model.ipynb` notebook, which provides a simple baseline segmentation model. This notebook will guide you through the initial steps of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

4. **Develop Your Model**:
    - **Preprocess the Data**: Use the `scripts/data_preprocessing.py` script to prepare the data for training.
    - **Train Your Model**: Modify and enhance the `scripts/train_model.py` to train your segmentation model. Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters.
    - **Evaluate Your Model**: Use the `scripts/evaluate_model.py` to assess the performance of your model on the validation set. Focus on metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and pixel accuracy.

#### Evaluation

Your submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- **Accuracy**: How accurately does your model segment the comic art images?
- **Generalization**: How well does your model perform across different comic styles in the dataset?
- **Innovation**: Novel approaches and innovative techniques will be highly regarded.

#### Resources

- **Baseline Notebooks**: `notebooks/baseline_model.ipynb`
- **Scripts**: `scripts/data_preprocessing.py`, `scripts/train_model.py`, `scripts/evaluate_model.py`
- **Evaluation Metrics**: IoU, pixel accuracy

We encourage participants to explore different approaches, share their findings, and collaborate to push the boundaries of computer vision in the domain of visual arts. Happy coding, and may the best model win!
