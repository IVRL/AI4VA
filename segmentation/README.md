#### Overview

Our workshop features two challenges focusing on applying computer vision to visual arts, centered around the AI4VA dataset. This dataset, a first-of-its-kind benchmark, is designed to evaluate vision modelsâ€™ ability to interpret comic art, with annotations on segmentation, depth, and saliency. It includes detailed annotations of diverse comic styles, such as the toon-styled 'Placid & Muzo'.

#### Dataset

The AI4VA dataset consists of images with detailed annotations on segmentation. These annotations include:

- **Character boundaries**: Precise outlines of characters.
- **Object segmentation**: Delineations of different objects within the scene.
- **Background segmentation**: Segmentation of the background elements.

The dataset covers a wide range of comic art styles, providing a comprehensive challenge for model generalization and accuracy.
