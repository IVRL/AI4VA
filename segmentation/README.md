#### Overview

Our workshop features **two challenges on depth and saliency** focusing on comics, centered around the AI4VA dataset. This dataset, a first-of-its-kind benchmark, is designed to evaluate vision modelsâ€™ ability to interpret comic art, with annotations on segmentation, depth, and saliency. It includes detailed annotations of diverse comic styles, such as the toon-styled 'Placid & Muzo'.
